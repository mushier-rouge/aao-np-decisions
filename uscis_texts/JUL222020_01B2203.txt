In Re: 8631621 
Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: JULY 22, 2020 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner , a surgeon, seeks classification as an alien of extraordinary ability. See Immigration and 
Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A) , 8 U.S.C. ยง 1153(b)(l)(A). This first preference 
classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability 
through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in 
their field through extensive documentation. 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not 
establish that the Petitioner had a one-time achievement (a major, internationally recognized award) 
or met at least three of the required evidentiary criteria. The matter is now before us on appeal. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records indicate that the Petitioner has adjusted to 
permanent resident status through an unrelated proceeding . The Petitioner filed Form 1-485, 
~tion to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, with receipt number! I 
L__Jon November 23, 2016. That application was approved on September 14, 2017. 
Because the Petitioner's status has been adjusted to permanent resident, further pursuit of the matter 
at hand is moot. 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed .
