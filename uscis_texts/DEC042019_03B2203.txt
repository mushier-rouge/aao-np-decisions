In Re: 1929753 
Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: DEC. 4, 2019 
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a marketing and advertising manager, seeks classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. ยง 
1153(b)(l)(A). This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can 
demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose 
achievements have been recognized in their field through extensive documentation. 
The Director of the Texas Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not 
establish that the Petitioner met at least three of the ten initial evidentiary criteria for this classification. 
On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that he meets at least three of the ten criteria and is eligible for the 
benefit sought. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) records indicate that the Petitioner filed a new 
Form I-140 prior to filing this appeal, in which he also requested classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. The Director of the Texas Service Center approved that petition on November 
30, 2018. As the Petitioner has an approved Fonn I-140 in the requested classification, further pursuit 
of this matter is moot. 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
