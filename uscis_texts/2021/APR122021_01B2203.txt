In Re: 15878036 
Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: APR. 12, 2021 
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a public relations professional, seeks classification as an individual of extraordinary 
ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act(the Act) section 203(b )(1 )(A),8 U.S.C. § 1153(b )(l)(A). 
This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their 
extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have 
been recognized in their field through extensive documentation. 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition, concluding that although the 
Petitioner established that he satisfied the initial evidence requirements for this classification, the 
record did not establish his sustained national or international acclaim and demonstrate that he is 
among the small percentage at the very top of the field of endeavor. The matter is now before us on 
appeal. 
In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. See 
Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361. Upon de nova review, we will sustain the appeal. 
I. LAW 
Section 203(b )(1) of the Act makes visas available to immigrants with extraordinary ability if: 
(i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education , business, or 
athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international 
acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through 
extensive documentation, 
(ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area of 
extraordinary ability, and 
(iii) the alien's entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively 
the United States. 
The term "extraordinary ability" refers only to those individuals in "that small percentage who have 
risen to the very top of the field of endeavor." 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2). The implementing regulation 
at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3) sets forth a multi-part analysis. First, a petitioner can demonstrate 
international recognition of his or her achievements in the field through a one-time achievement (that 
is, a major, internationally recognized award). If that petitioner does not submit this evidence, then 
he or she must provide sufficient qualifying documentation that meets at least three of the ten crite1ia 
listed at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x) (including items such as awards, published material in ce1iain 
media, and scholarly articles). 
Where a petitioner meets these initial evidence requirements, we then consider the totality of the 
material provided in a final merits determination and assess whether the record shows sustained 
national or international acclaim and demonstrates that the individual is among the small percentage 
at the very top of the field of endeavor. See Kazarian v. USCJS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010) 
( discussing a two-part review where the documentation is first counted and then, if fulfilling the 
required number of criteria, considered in the context of a final merits determination); see also 
Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 131-32(D.D.C. 20l3);Rijalv. USCIS, 772 F. Supp. 2d 1339 
(W.D. Wash. 2011). 
II. ANALYSIS 
The record reflects that the Petitioner is currently employed as the Director of Communications, USA 
fo~ I He has nearly 20 years of experience in the media and public relations field, 
including 13 years performing in senior roles for major internationad I 
A. Evidentiary Criteria 
Because the Petitioner has not indicated or established that he has received a major, internationally 
recognized award, he must satisfy at least three of the alternate regulatory criteria at 
8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). The Petitioner submitted evidence in support of six of the ten criteria, 
and the Director determined that the Petitioner met three of those evidentiary criteria, relating to 
judging, leading or critical roles, and high salary, at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(iv), (viii), and (ix). The 
Director then proceeded to a final merits determination and concluded that the Petitioner did not 
demonstrate that he has sustained national and international acclaim an dis among the small percentage 
at the very top of his field. 
On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that he meets at least one additional criterion, related to published 
materials in professional or major trade publications or other major media, at 8 C.F.R. 
§ 2 04. 5 (h )(3 )(iii). He also maintains that the Director's decision failed to discuss much of the relevant 
evidence submitted in support of the petition and thus did not properly consider the record in its 
entirety when evaluating his eligibility for the benefit sought. 
We agree with the Director's determination that the Petitioner has satisfied at least three of the 
regulatory criteria. Accordingly, we will evaluate the totality of the evidence, including evidence the 
Petitioner submitted in support of the published materials and other criteria, in the context of the final 
merits determination below.

B. Final Merits Determination 
In a final merits determination, we evaluate whether the Petitioner has demonstrated, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that he has sustained national or international acclaim, that his 
achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation, and that he is among 
the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. See section 
203(b )(1 )(A)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), (3);see also Kazarian, 596 F.3d at 1119-20. 1 After 
evaluating the evidence in the aggregate, we conclude that the Petitioner has demonstrated that his 
achievements are reflective ofa "career of acclaimed work in the field" as contemplated by Congress.

Petitioner's achievements are reflective of a "career of acclaimed work in the field" as contemplated

acclaim and that his achievements have been recognized through extensive documentation. Finally, 
5 
he has also established that he intends to continue working in his area of expertise and that his 
admission will benefit prospectively the United States. He therefore qualifies for classification as an 
individual of extraordinary ability. 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
