In Re: 17643810 
Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: AUG. 20, 2021 
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a cinematographer/director of photography, seeks classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b )(1 )(A), 8 U.S.C. 
§ 1153(b )(1 )(A). This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who 
can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and 
whose achievements have been recognized in their field through extensive documentation. 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition, concluding that although the record 
established that the Petitioner satisfied the initial evidentiary requirements for this classification, it did 
not demonstrate, as required, that he has sustained national or international acclaim and is among the 
small percentage at the top of his field. The matter is now before us on appeal. 
In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit by a 
preponderance of the evidence. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N 
Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). Upon de novo review, we will sustain the appeal. 
I. LAW 
Section 203(b)(l)(A) of the Act makes immigrant visas available to aliens with extraordinary ability if: 
(i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or 
athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international 
acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through 
extensive documentation, 
(ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue work m the area of 
extraordinary ability, and 
(iii) the alien's entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively the 
United States. 
The term "extraordinary ability" refers only to those individuals in "that small percentage who have 
risen to the very top of the field of endeavor." 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2). The implementing regulation 
at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3) sets forth a multi-part analysis. First, a petitioner can demonstrate 
international recognition of his or her achievements in the field through a one-time achievement (that 
is, a major, internationally recognized award). If the petitioner does not submit this evidence, then he 
or she must provide sufficient qualifying documentation that meets at least three of the ten criteria 
listed at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)---(x) (including items such as awards, published material in certain 
media, and scholarly aiiicles). 
Where a petitioner meets these initial evidence requirements, we then consider the totality of the 
material provided in a final merits determination and assess whether the record shows sustained 
national or international acclaim and demonstrates that the individual is among the small percentage 
at the very top of the field of endeavor. See Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010) 
( discussing a two-paii review where the documentation is first counted and then, if fulfilling the 
required number of criteria, considered in the context of a final merits dete1mination); see also 
Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 131-32(D.D.C. 2013);Rijalv. USCIS, 772 F. Supp. 2d 1339 
(W.D. Wash. 2011). 
II. ANALYSIS 
The Petitioner is a director of photography/cinematographer with an extensive list of film and 
television credits in the United Kingdom and the United States. The record reflects that he intends to 
continue work in his area of expertise and was under contract and/or in negotiations to work on several 
upcoming feature film and television projects in the United States at the time of filing. 
A. Evidentiary Criteria 
Because the Petitioner has not indicated or established that he has received a major, internationally 
recognized award, he must satisfy at least three of the alternate regulatory criteria at 
8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). The Petitioner submitted evidence related to eight of these ten criteria, 
and the Director determined that he satisfied three of them, relating to his receipt of lesser nationally 
or internationally recognized awards, published material about him and his work, and the display of 
his work at artistic exhibitions or showcases. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i), (iii) and (vii). 
Afterreviewing the record, we agree with the Director's conclusion that the Petitioner satisfied at least 
three of the initial evidentiary criteria and will therefore turn to the final merits determination below. 
B. Final Merits Determination 
As the Petitioner satisfied at least three of the regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x), we 
will analyze the Petitioner's accomplishments and weigh the totality of the evidence to determine if 
his successes are sufficient to demonstrate that he has extraordinary ability in the field of endeavor. 
In a final merits determination, we must evaluate whether he has demonstrated, by a preponderance 
of the evidence, that he has sustained national or international acclaim and that his achievements have 
been recognized in the field through extensive documentation, making him one of the small percentage 
who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. See section 203(b )(1 )(A)(i) of the Act; 8 
C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), (3): see also Kazarian, 596 F.3d at 1119-20. Upon review, we conclude that the 
Petitioner has demonstrated his eligibility for this classification.

directors of photography who have proved themselves to be among the very best in the field." The 
supporting evidence describing the~membership requirements and standards for full membership 
supports this statement and indicates that those selected must have at least five years of substantial 
film and television credits and be judged as having outstanding artistic achievements in 
cinematography. The number of fully accreditedc=Jmembers is small, at just over 100, and reflects 
that those admitted are at the top of the field amon~ I cinematographers. While the membership 
requirements fo~ I appear to be somewhat less stringent, the Petitioner's full voting 
membership in that association indicates that he is regarded as an artist who has made a "significant 
contribution" to his industry. The record reflects that the Petitioner has received further recognition 
......... ~~~~~~~~......_r a~ _________ __.by serving as an invited panelist at the

his prominent upcoming projects (including a~-------------~----__._), 
high remuneration relative to his peers, and demonstrated record of working with renowned directors 
on critically acclaimed and award-winning projects. When considered in the aggregate with the 
evidence discussed above, the Petitioner has demonstrated that his achievements are reflective of a 
"career of acclaimed work in the field" as contemplated by Congress. H.R. Rep. No. 101-723, 59 
(Sept. 19, 1990). We conclude that the record supports a finding that the Petitioner is among the small 
percentage at the top of his field of endeavor and that he has sustained national or international acclaim. 
See 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2)-(3). 
III. CONCLUSION 
The Petitioner has shown that he meets at least three of the evidentiary criteria listed at 8 C.F.R. 
§ 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). He has also demonstrated sustained national and international acclaim and that 
his achievements have been recognized through extensive documentation. Lastly, the Petitioner has 
shown that he intends to continue working in his area of expertise and that his work will substantially 
benefit prospectively the United States. He therefore qualifies for classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
