In Re: 23271189 
Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: NOV. 14, 2022 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a researcher in the field of neurobiology, seeks classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. 
ยง 1153(b)(l)(A). This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who 
can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and 
whose achievements have been recognized in their field through extensive documentation . 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not 
establish that the Petitioner had satisfied at least three of ten initial evidentiary criteria, as required. 
The matter is now before us on appeal. 
The Petitioner has filed two appeals of the Director's decision. We sustained the other appeal, which 
has rendered this one moot, and it will be dismissed on that basis. 1 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed. 
1 The Petitioner filed two separate appeals of the Director's decision, and we are adjudicating both today. Sustaining the 
other appeal has rendered this appeal moot, and it will be dismissed on that basis. 
However , because the other appeal I I is being sustained, the end result for the Petitioner will be approval 
of the underlying I-140 petition.
