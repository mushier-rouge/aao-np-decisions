In Re: 23551665 
Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: NOV. 25, 2022 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a research scientist, seeks to classify himself as an individual of extraordinary ability. 
See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1153(b)(l)(A) . This 
first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their 
extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have 
been recognized in their field through extensive documentation . 
The Director of the Texas Service Center denied the petition, concluding the record did not establish 
that the Petitioner met at least three of the ten required evidentiary criteria at 8 C.F.R. ยง 204.5(h)(3 ). 
The matter is now before us on appeal. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) records indicate that a different Form 1-140, 
Immigrant Petition for an Alien Worker, filed by the Petitioner was approved after the instant appeal. 
USCIS records further show that a Form 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust 
Status, was approved subsequent to the filing of this appeal and that the Petitioner was issued a 
Permanent Resident Card on February 8, 2022. As the Petitioner is presently a permanent resident, 
further pursuit of this matter is moot. 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
