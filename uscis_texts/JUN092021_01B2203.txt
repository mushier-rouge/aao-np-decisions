In Re: 16715565 
Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: JUN. 09, 2021 
Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a make-up artist, seeks classification as an individual of extraordinaiy ability. See 
Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A) , 8 U.S.C. ยง 1153(b)(l)(A) . This first 
preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their 
extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have 
been recognized in their field through extensive documentation . 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition concluding that the Petitioner did not 
establish that she satisfies the initial evidentiary requirements for this classification. The Director 
affirmed his decision on motion, and we dismissed the Petitioner's subsequent appeal of that decision. 
The matter is now before us on a combined motion to reopen and motion to reconsider. The Petitioner 
requests that we reopen the matter sua sponte and order the approval of her immigrant petition. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) records reflect that the Petitioner in this matter is 
also the beneficiary of an approved Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. USCIS approved the 
Petitioner's Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, and she was 
granted conditional permanent residence on February 2, 2021, subsequent to filing the instant motion. 
Because the Petitioner is now a permanent resident, further pursuit of this matter would be moot 
Accordingly , we will dismiss the combined motions. 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is dismissed. 
FURTHER ORDER : The motion to reconsider is dismissed .
