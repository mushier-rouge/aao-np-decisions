Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: MAY 10, 2024 In Re: 31201612 
Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a data center/network engineer in the pharmaceutical industry, requests classification 
under the employment-based, first-preference (EB-1) immigrant visa category as a noncitizen with 
"extraordinary ability." See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A) , 8 U.S.C. 
ยง ll 53(b)(1)(A). Petitioners in this category must demonstrate "sustained national or international 
acclaim" and extensively document recognition of their achievements in their fields. Id. 
The Director of the Texas Service Center denied the petition. The Director concluded that the 
Petitioner met two of ten initial evidentiary criteria -one less than required for a final merits 
determination . 
This is the Petitioner's second submission regarding this petition. He previously appealed the 
petition's denial. Seel IWe will issue a separate decision on the first appeal. 
This submission raises the same issues as the Petitioner's first appeal. As a matter of prudence, we 
may dismiss appeals and motions that lack practical significance. Matter ofReyes, 26 I&N Dec. 528, 
528 n.3 (BIA 2015). We will therefore dismiss the submission as moot. 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
