In Re: 10070333 
Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: SEPT. 24, 2020 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a physiatrist specialist, seeks classification as an alien of extraordinary ability. See 
Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(l)(A). This first 
preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their 
extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have 
been recognized in their field through extensive documentation. 
The Director of the Texas Service Center denied the petition, concluding that although the Petitioner 
satisfied at least three of the initial evidentiary criteria, as required, he did not show sustained national 
or international acclaim and demonstrate that he is among the small percentage at the very top of the 
field of endeavor. Subsequently, the Director dismissed the Petitioner's joint motion to reopen and 
motion to reconsider as untimely filed. 
In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. See 
Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361. Upon de nova review, we will withdraw the decision and 
remand the matter to the Director. 
I. LAW 
Section 203(b)(l)(A) of the Act makes visas available to immigrants with extraordinary ability if: 
(i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or 
athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international 
acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through 
extensive documentation, 
(ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area of 
extraordinary ability, and 
(iii) the alien's entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively 
the United States. 
The term "extraordinary ability" refers only to those individuals in "that small percentage who have 
risen to the very top of the field of endeavor." 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2). The implementing regulation 
at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3) sets forth a multi-part analysis. First, a petitioner can demonstrate recognition 
of his or her achievements in the field through a one-time achievement (that is, a major, internationally 
recognized award). If that petitioner does not submit this evidence, then he or she must provide 
sufficient qualifying documentation that meets at least three of the ten criteria listed at 8 C.F.R. 
§ 204.5(h)(3)(i) -(x) (including items such as awards, published material in certain media, and 
scholarly articles). 
Where a petitioner meets these initial evidence requirements, we then consider the totality of the 
material provided in a final merits determination and assess whether the record shows sustained 
national or international acclaim and demonstrates that the individual is among the small percentage 
at the very top of the field of endeavor. See Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010). 
( discussing a two-part review where the documentation is first counted and then, if fulfilling the 
required number of criteria, considered in the context of a final merits determination); see also 
Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 131-32 (D.D.C. 2013); Rijal v. USCIS, 772 F. Supp. 2d 1339 
(W.D. Wash. 2011). 
II. ANALYSIS 
Because the Petitioner did not establish that he received a major, internationally recognized award, he 
claimed to satisfy at least three of the ten alternate regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). 
Ultimately, the Director determined that the Petitioner met four of those criteria: published material 
under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(iii), judging under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(iv), scholarly articles under 8 
C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(vi), and leading or critical role under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(viii). As such, the 
Director conducted a final merits determination and concluded that the Petitioner did not show that he 
garnered sustained national or international acclaim and that his achievements have been recognized 
in the field of expertise, demonstrating that he is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very 
top of the field. 1 The Director subsequently decided that the Petitioner untimely filed his joint motion 
to reopen and motion to reconsider and dismissed the motions. 
Motions must be filed within 30 days of the decision.2 See 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(l)(i). If the decision 
was mailed, 3 days will be added to the filing time requirement. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.8(b). When the 
last day of a period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period shall run until the end of 
the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. See 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. USCIS will consider 
a benefit request received and will record the receipt date as of the actual date of receipt at the location 
designated for filing such benefit request whether electronically or in paper format. 8 C.F.R. 
§ 103. l(a)(7)(i).

https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual /HTML/PolicyManual.html (providing that objectively meeting the regulatory 
criteria in part one alone does not establish that an individual meets the requirements for classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability under section 203(b)(l)(A) of the Act). 
2 The 30-day filing period for a motion to reopen "may be excused in the discretion of the Service where it is demonstrated 
that the delay was reasonable and was beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner." 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(l)(i) . 
2 
The record reflects that the Director denied the petition by mail on September 12, 2019.3 As such, the 
regulations permitted the Petitioner to file a motion within 3 3 days, or by October 15, 2019 (Tuesday). 4 
See 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.5(a)(l)(i) and 103.8(b). The Director determined that the Petitioner filed the 
motions on October 18, 2019, 36 days after the decision. However, although USCIS receipted the 
motions on October 18, 2019, the record establishes that USCIS actually received the motions on 
October 15, 2019, within the 33-day timeframe to file motions.5 See 8 C.F.R. § 103.l(a)(7)(i). 
Therefore, the Director incorrectly dismissed the motions as untimely filed. 
Accordingly, we will remand the matter to the Director to consider all of the arguments and 
documentation in the record, including on motion and on appeal, to determine whether the totality of 
the evidence overcomes the initial decision denying the petition, and whether the Petitioner established 
sustained national or international acclaim and that his achievements have been recognized in the field 
of expertise, demonstrating that he is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the 
field. See Kazarian, 596 F.3d at 1115. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The Director erroneously dismissed the motions as untimely filed. As such, we will remand the matter 
for further consideration of the record, including claims and documentation submitted on motion and 
on appeal, and entty of a new decision. 6 
ORDER: The decision of the Director, Texas Service Center, is withdrawn. The matter is 
remanded to the Director, Texas Service Center, for further proceedings consistent with 
the foregoing opinion and for the entty of a new decision, which, if adverse, shall be 
certified to us for review. 
3 The Director indicated in his introductory discussion paragraph that "[o ]n September 5, 2019, Form 1-140 was denied by 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS) .... " However, in his conclusory paragraph, the Director stated that 
"[t]he notice ofUSClS's decision to deny the Form 1-140 was sent on September 12, 2019." The record shows the denial 
decision dated on September 12, 2019, as the official decision date. 
4 Columbus Day, a legal holiday, fell on Monday, October 14, 2019. 
5 The record contains a stamped date of "OCT 15 2019 A.M. 02" on the envelope. In addition, the U.S. Postal Service 
tracking number attached to the envelope confirms delivery on October 15, 2019 at 5:33 AM. See

6 We have the authority to withdraw a decision and remand the case for further action, with an order that it be certified 
back to us if the new decision is adverse to the affected party. USCIS Policy Memorandum PM-602-0087, Certification

of the remanded case, but is designed to preserve the affected party's ability to seek appellate review without payment of 
a second appeal fee. Id.
