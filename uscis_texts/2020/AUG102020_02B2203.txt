In Re: 9732760 
Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the 
Administrative Appeals Office 
Date: AUG. 10, 2020 
Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) 
The Petitioner, a musician and music producer, seeks classification as an individual of extraordinary 
ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(l)(A) . 
This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their 
extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have 
been recognized in their field through extensive documentation . 
The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the petition, concluding that record did not 
establish that the Petitioner has received a major, internationally recognized award or that he meets at 
least three of the ten alternate evidentiary criteria for this classification . 
On appeal, the Petitioner contends that he meets four of the evidentiary criteria and otherwise qualifies 
for the benefit sought. 
In these proceedings , it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. See 
Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361. Upon de nova review, we will sustain the appeal. 
I. LAW 
Section 203(b )(1) of the Act makes visas available to immigrants with extraordinary ability if: 
(i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or 
athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international 
acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through 
extensive documentation, 
(ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area of 
extraordinary ability, and 
(iii) the alien's entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively 
the United States. 
The term "extraordinary ability" refers only to those individuals in "that small percentage who have 
risen to the very top of the field of endeavor." 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2). The implementing regulation 
at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3) sets forth a multi-part analysis. First, a petitioner can demonstrate sustained 
acclaim and the recognition of his or her achievements in the field through a one-time achievement 
(that is, a major, internationally recognized award). If that petitioner does not submit this evidence, 
then he or she must provide sufficient qualifying documentation that meets at least three of the ten 
categories listed at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i) -(x) (including items such as awards, published material 
in certain media, and scholarly articles). 
Where a petitioner meets these initial evidence requirements, we then consider the totality of the 
material provided in a final merits determination and assess whether the record shows sustained 
national or international acclaim and demonstrates that the individual is among the small percentage 
at the very top of the field of endeavor. See Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010) 
( discussing a two-part review where the documentation is first counted and then, if fulfilling the 
required number of criteria, considered in the context of a final merits determination); see also 
Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 131-32 (D.D.C. 2013); Rijal v. USCIS, 772 F. Supp. 2d 1339 
(W.D. Wash. 2011). This two-step analysis is consistent with our holding that the "truth is to be 
determined not by the quantity of evidence alone but by its quality," as well as the principle that we 
examine "each piece of evidence for relevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and 
within the context of the totality of the evidence, to determine whether the fact to be proven is probably 
true." Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 376 (AAO 2010). 
II. ANALYSIS 
The Petitioner is a musician, music producer and former record company executive who intends to 
continue working as a producer, recording artist, and touring musician in the United States. 
A. Evidentiary Criteria 
Because the Petitioner has not indicated or established that he has received a major, internationally 
recognized award, he must satisfy at least three of the alternate regulatory criteria at 
8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). In denying the petition, the Director found that the Petitioner claimed, 
but did not meet, the criteria for awards, published material, judging, display in artistic showcases or 
exhibitions, and leading or critical role under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i), (iii), (iv), (vii), and (viii), 
respectively. 1 
On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that he meets up to four criteria and that he qualifies as an individual 
of extraordinary ability. We have reviewed all the evidence in the record of proceedings, and we find 
that the Petitioner has sufficiently demonstrated that he meets at least three criteria. 
In determining that the Petitioner did not satisfy the published materials criterion at 8 C.F.R. § 
204.5(h)(3)(viii), the Director generally stated that the Petitioner submitted: "internet ads" and 
"material posted in web portals or other social media," and "a multitude of online articles," that are 
1 We note that the Petitioner did not claim to meet the criterion related to receipt of lesser nationally or internationally 
recognized awards or prizes at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i). 
2 
considered "posting not published material." Out of the dozens of media articles submitted, the 
Director specifically referenced only four of them, two of which were not submitted under this 
criterion. While not every submitted article meets this criterion, the record contains articles about the 
Petitioner and relating to his work which were published by major newspapers including The New 
York Times and Los Angeles Times and industry publications such as Billboard and Rolling Stone. 
With respect to the judging criterion at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5}h)(3)(iv), the Director acknowledged that the 
Petitioner submitted evidence related to thd.__ ___ __, short film competition, but found insufficient 
documentation to establish that he actually participated as a judge in the event, that he judged the work 
of others in his field, or that his judging activities were at a level "consistent with sustained national 
or international acclaim." However, the evidence submitted clearly establishes the Petitioner's 
~ipation on a three-person panel of jurors in the 1 I' category at the 2008 I I 
L_J festival. This evidence confirms that the jurors were responsible for selecting a category winner, 
and that short films submitted in the.__ ____ __,' category are music videos and therefore within 
the Petitioner's field of expertise. The Petitioner does not need to establish that his judging activities 
are a level "consistent with national or international acclaim" in order to satisfy the plain language of 
this criterion. 
The Director determined that the Petitioner did not meet the criterion relating to the display of his 
work at artistic exhibitions or showcases at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(vi) based on a finding that the 
criterion is intended for visual artists, not performing artists. We disagree with the Director's 
interpretation that the plain language of the regulation renders this criterion applicable only to visual 
artists. The regulation requires only that the work displayed be a given petitioner's own work product 
and that the venues at which the individual's work was displayed be artistic exhibitions or showcases. 
8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(vii).2 As certain exhibitions or showcases featuring performing artists meet 
the plain language of this regulation, the Director should not have summarily disregarded the 
Petitioner's evidence. Here, for example, the Petitioner provided evidence that he and his bands have 
performed for audiences at many music festivals. Accordingly, we conclude that the submitted 
evidence satisfies the plain language of this criterion. 
As the Petitioner meets at least three of the ten criteria listed at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3), he has satisfied 
the initial evidentiary requirements for this classification. We will evaluate the totality of the evidence, 
including the documentation relating to the other criterion he has claimed, in the context of the final 
merits determination below. 
B. Final Merits Determination 
In a final merits determination, we evaluate whether the Petitioner has demonstrated, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that he has sustained national or international acclaim and that his 
achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation, making him one of 
the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. See section

When considered in the aggregate with the evidence discussed below, the Petitioner has demonstrated 
that his achievements are reflective of a "career of acclaimed work in the field" as contemplated by 
Congress. H.R. Rep. No. 101-723, 59 (Sept. 19, 1990). 
The record reflects that the Petitioner began his career in the music industry as a teenager, when he

artists and repertoire (A&R) and later, from 2008 until 2011, served asl ~s chairman. A 
2006 profile of the Petitioner published by the Los Angeles Times noted that, "[the Petitioner] at 30, is 
the first of his generation in Mexico to assume control of a major record label" and "part of a small 
but growing group of people who are coming into power in Mexico with new ways to look at the 
market and the music." The article goes on to note that "[ d]uring his tenure, the label leaped from 
fifth to second place in the market" in large part due to the success of artists that the Petitioner signed 
and helped to develop. The Petitioner also provided evidence that Billboard magazine, a major trade 
publication in the music industry, consistently reported on his career atl I

and tour the United States, and to produce and remix music for other acclaimed artists. 
Based on the evidence of the Petitioner's achievements and earned recognition discussed above, the 
Petitioner has demonstrated his extraordinary ability as a musician and producer and established that 
he is regarded as having a "career of acclaimed work in the field." See H. Rep. No. 101-723, at 59 
(Sept. 19, 1990). The totality of the evidence establishes that he possesses a level of expertise that is 
consistent with a finding that he is one of a small percentage at the very top of the field of endeavor 
and that he has documented sustained acclaim. See section 203(b)(l)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. 
§ 204.5(h)(2), (3); Kazarian, 596 F.3d at 1119-20. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The Petitioner has established that he meets at least three of the evidentiary criteria listed at 8 C.F.R. 
§ 204.5(h)(3)(i)-(x). He has also demonstrated sustained national and international acclaim and that 
his achievements have been recognized through extensive documentation. Lastly, the Petitioner has 
shown that he intends to continue working in his area of expertise and that he will substantially benefit 
prospectively the United States. He therefore qualifies for classification as an individual of 
extraordinary ability. 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
